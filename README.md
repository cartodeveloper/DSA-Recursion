# Recursion

Did you mean recursion? A method of solving problems that involves a function calling itself. In each call, it breaks down the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems until you get to a problem small enough that it can be solved trivially.

## A recursive algorithm is broken down into 2 parts:

1. Base case (i.e., when to stop)
   The base case is the solution to the "simplest" possible problem. The base case does not require calling itself or any recursive case.

2. General, or recursive case (i.e., function calling itself)
   The recursive case is where we use the same algorithm to solve a simpler version of the problem. This is where the method calls itself with the same number of parameters to solve a smaller version of the problem.
